# 🌳 Nested Tags Tree Editor (React + Vite)

This project is a **React + Vite** application that allows users to **view, edit, and manage hierarchical tree data** dynamically.  
It was built as part of an assignment to implement a nested tag structure with features like **adding children, renaming nodes, editing data fields, collapsing/expanding nodes, and exporting JSON**.
